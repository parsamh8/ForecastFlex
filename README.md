## Installation

N/A


## Usage

The app allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name, which sends a request to the backend API. The backend processes the request and retrieves the weather data from an external API, returning it to the client for display. The app also stores your search history, which can be retrieved with a GET request to /api/weather/history, and individual entries can be deleted using a DELETE request. This setup allows users to view current weather AND forecast next 4 days, track their searches, and manage their search history easily.
